      <p class="card-text content">In November and December, I was given the chance to implement a completely new feature for the desktop app of the company's platform. Although the design had been laid out beforehand, most (around 70%) of the implementation was left to me to code. This made for a really rewarding experience, where I was able to learn how to combine completely new code within the existing codebase, along with all the testing and documentation that comes with a new feature. I am very grateful I was allowed to undertake a task of this calibre and this was definitely the highest high for me this work term.</p>
