    <h1>CONCLUSION</h1>
    <p>And that's it, we've reached the end of the work term, and the end of the work term report as well. I hope you had as much fun reading this as I did designing and coding this website. Despite the pecuilar circumstances with COVID-19 forcing the work term to be entirely remote, it was honestly an eye opener to see how a tech based company operates on a day to day basis. There's definitely more than what meets the eye when it comes to operating the machine that is a company. I definitely picked up many skills for the future, and I achieved the goals I set out for myself. I'm glad Camis gave me the opportunity to have an extremely rewarding first (and second work term, coming up this fall!) work experience in the field.</p>
