        <h5>Be able to write concise, detailed bug reports</h5>
        <p>Most of the time, I still need to double check with teammates on whether something is an issue before going ahead with the ticket, especially if the issue at play is not a major component breaking bug. With larger issues however, I can now use proper judgement and make the ticket without guidance. I think I couldn;t complete this goal due to an unconscious habit in not wanting to make tickets over nothing and wasting other people’s time. I think that as I move forward, this should become less of an issue as I’ve realized that non issues can simply be closed without issue with a few clicks, which is faster than waiting for a response from teammates, since they can be busy with their own work, making for a better work experience for everyone.</p>
