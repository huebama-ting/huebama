        <p class="text-center content">Most of the time, I still need to double check with teammates on whether something is an issue before going ahead with the ticket, especially if the issue at play is not a major component breaking bug. With larger issues however, I can now use proper judgement and make the ticket without guidance. I think I couldn;t complete this goal due to an unconscious habit in not wanting to make tickets over nothing and wasting other people’s time. I think that as I move forward, this should become less of an issue as I’ve realized that non issues can simply be closed without issue with a few clicks, which is faster than waiting for a response from teammates, since they can be busy with their own work, making for a better work experience for everyone.</p>

        <p class="card-text content">As this was my first technical job in the software field, I wanted to achieve an understanding of how a software company operates on a day to day basis. Experiencing the agile methodology at work on a large scale was a really rewarding experience and will definitely help me in my next work term as a software developer co-op (also at Camis!) seeing as I can hit the ground running with 4 months of daily standups and general knowledge of short work sprints, making the adjustment from a QA type sprint to a dev oriented sprint that much easier.</p>
