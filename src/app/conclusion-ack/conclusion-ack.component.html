            And there we go, another work term complete, and another work term report complete! Hopefully this report was fun to read! This was yet again another remote work term, but I still picked up many new things and honestly, this work term completely exceeded my expectations! After this work term, I definitely would not mind working a long term full time position that deals with developing automated tests, as it was very fun and rewarding! I'm looking forward to seeing where co-op takes me next, and hopefully the ride does not let up!</p>
