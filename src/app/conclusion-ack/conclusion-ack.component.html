            And the final co-op work term report, along with the fifth and final co-op work term itself are complete! Hopefully this report properly conveyed all the feelings I had during the past eight months! Settling back into a developer role, I managed to pick up many new skills and learned about a lot of new technologies, so I think I can rate this as the most fuffilling co-op term I have had. Co-op has been a fun ride from start to finish, and it has definitely prepared me for what is to come after graduation in a lot of ways I did not expect, so I am very glad I got the chance to work while at school!</p>
