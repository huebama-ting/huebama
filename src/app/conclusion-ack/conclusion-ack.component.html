          <p class="content">And that's it, we've reached the end of another work term, and the end of the work term report again. I hope you had as much fun reading the newest edition of this work term report as I did designing and coding this website! Despite the pecuilar circumstances with COVID-19 forcing the work term to be entirely remote yet again, I ultimately had a great time, although I am sure it would have been even more fun in person. Once again, I definitely picked up many new skills for the future, and I achieved the goals I set out for myself. After it's all said and done, I'm very glad Camis gave me the opportunity to have an extremely rewarding first development oriented work term, and I will no doubt look forward to what's in store for me next!</p>
