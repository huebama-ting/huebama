          <p class="content">And that's it, we've reached the end of the work term, and the end of the work term report as well. I hope you had as much fun reading this as I did designing and coding this website! Despite the pecuilar circumstances with COVID-19 forcing the work term to be entirely remote, it was honestly an eye opener to see how a tech based company operates on a day to day basis. There's definitely more than what meets the eye when it comes to operating the machine that is a company ðŸ˜‰. I definitely picked up many new skills for the future, and I achieved the goals I set out for myself. After it's all said and done, I'm very glad Camis gave me the opportunity to have an extremely rewarding first (and second, too, coming up this fall!) work experience in the field.</p>
