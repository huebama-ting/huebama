        <p>This is an opinion that I see going around a lot, especially during the job search period for students approaching their first work term.</p>
        <p>This isn't really true, since it's good to get ANY job experience on the first work term. Additionally, QA and dev go hand in hand; not having developers means no product, just as not having QA in the mix means no <i>deliverable</i> product. Both roles are essential!</p>
        <p>While a QA job may be less than ideal for many people due the percieved lack of coding involved, it was anything but that for me. I had tons of fun on the job, and I definitely wouldn't mind doing it some more.</p>
        <p>At the end of the day, both QA and developer jobs are technical jobs in the field, each with their pros and cons, but ultimately the line that separates them is quite blurred; there is bug testing a component when writing code, and there is writing code bug testing a component. There are definitely no ranks involved, and everyone should give QA a shot to see if they like it before making their judgement.</p>
