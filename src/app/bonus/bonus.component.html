        <p class="content">This is an opinion that I see going around a lot, especially during the job search period when students are rushing to land job offers.</p>
        <p class="content">Now that I've had a work term of each type under my belt, I can say that this definitely is not true!!</p>
        <p class="content">By having some previous QA experience, even though there is little to no coding involved, you make yourself a better programmer by virtue of knowing how to write more robust code since as QA, you often encounter testing situations in which code hasn't been fully tested, leading to avoidable bugs. Thus, through these situations you can learn how to write better code and not repeat the mistakes others have made.</p>
        <p class="content">At the end of the day, both QA and developer jobs are technical jobs in the field. It's never a bad idea to diversify your skills and experiences by working in both fields!</p>
